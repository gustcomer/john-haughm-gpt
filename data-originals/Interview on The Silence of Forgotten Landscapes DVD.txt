PREPROCESSED

I wanted to have a name for a band that really captured the element and aesthetic of wood smoke on a winter night. that smell and that feeling and so, you know, I didn't want to use a word or whatever that was just as prosaic as wood smoke. but Eventually I found the word agalloc. it was in an old dictionary and it was a type of wood that's burned for its unique smoke and so it was perfect for what I wanted and it didn't pigeonhole us into one stylistic corner, or genre, or whatever. And so that that was the name we went with and it's perfect.

Well, I met John in 1996 through a mutual friend. We were both at the time putting together demos for our individual projects, mine being Sculptured his being Agalloch, and we had tremendous amounts of things in common with regards to music, cinema and so just naturally we started collaborating. When it came time to do From Which of this Oak demo I came down the studio, did some guitar solos and thought that was going to be it and that I was gonna go on and focus on my own project. But as it turns out another mutual friend Jason Walton flew out to work with me, and were working with John and from there we began forming Agalloch into pretty much a full working band. And that's when we started charting ideas for what eventually became Pale Folklore.

I met John in 1991. We were both living in Montana, we were in high school and we were both in different bands in the Montana area. We got to know each other there and we played a couple of shows with each other and so we've been good friends for a very long time. Years and years later he introduced me to Don and at the time Don was just starting Sculptured and he released the first demo and I heard it and I was living in Minneapolis at the time and I wanted to leave. So basically, Don I became really good friends and I moved out to Portland to join sculpture and John was living here as well so that worked out really well for everybody. So this was after the first sculptured album was recorded So Don and I were working on Sculptured and John was working on Agalloch and it was after the first Agalloch demo as well and just because we're all good friends and we all had the same taste in music, we started to work on Pale Folklore Together.

The attitude of the band since the beginning has always been a very take it or leave it kind of attitude. We've never really wanted to ever give in to any sort of hype, or care what the scene is doing at the time. We just do what we enjoy what we do and we just kind of put it out there and it's like take it or leave it, love it or hate it but we're not going to take it any further than that in terms of promoting ourselves or anything because I've never been interested in that and I've never really been interested in the whole concept of following a linear path to success or whatever. I've always just been more interested in cultivating and maintaining a strong cult following and that's the most important thing to me and to us and if success or whatever comes from that then it's just going to naturally happen or it won't so that's the attitude that we've always had and the attitude that we still have and we'll always have until the end.

Pale Folklore is still an album that I feel a great deal of Pride for and I still listen to it regularly. I feel like at that time we achieved what we wanted to achieve. We had very specific direction with this album, we had our points of departure being Fields of the Nephilin, some of the older Catatonia and of course the early Ulver work. We kind of wanted to combine those three and bring the sort of Fields of the Nephilim mood to black metal. I remember when we recorded Pale Folklore we had a friend visiting at the time and we hadn't laid down the clean tone guitar parts yet, and when we did, he remarked he didn't like them at all and so we knew we were doing something hopefully original at that time. I think we started kind of maybe a new sound with that sort of mixing, that cling tone guitar going over, sort of heavy black metal guitars, and I find that to be pretty much a key identity for Agalloch.

Pale Folklore was a really interesting experience for all of us I think because it was our first exploration into Agalloch as a full band and it was a journey of discovery for us and it was basically us getting together and creating an album that we all wanted to hear. It had a lot of different influences from Ulver to Catatonia, to Fields of the Nephilim, bands that we all appreciated. It's a record I still look back on today and I feel like we made a really solid record that still stands up.

That album, although it wasn't a conceptual album per se, it definitely followed the kind of red thread. I remember telling the engineer when we were creating it that I wanted it to be the sort of album that you could imagine you know you're lost in the woods and it's snowing and it's cold and you know you're gonna die if you don't find you know a shelter or something, and the wind is blowing and it's just brutal. Then you find a cabin that's falling apart, ruins of a cabin, and you make it to these to this ruins of this cabin and you open the door and it's illuminated and there's a fire and it's warm. It's kind of a transformation from life and death, it's from this coldness brutality outside of life, and of death being this kind of warm comfortable place. That run-down Cabin in the Woods is where you're going to be forever and that's kind of what I told the engineer. I kind of gave that story to the engineer to paint this aesthetic picture of where we wanted to go with that album and how I wanted that album to to feel and whatnot, so that was Pale Folklore. There are certain things on it looking back that sure I would like to change. I think it would be a lot better if we did an album like that nowadays but that's where we were in 1998-99.

With The Mantle, I feel like this was an album that we made where we felt the most that there was endless possibilities with where we could go. And having done Pale Folklore sort of more a black metal statement, both John and I were spending a lot of time in Portland discovering new music together and we went and saw Godspeed You Black Emperor! live and it was very inspirational. We felt like what was going on with that sort of so-called post-rock scene, those sort of groups could really easily translate into black metal. And we were also listening to a lot of like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and we really wanted to bring that and also the Neofolk stuff we were into with Crew 93 and Sol Invictus and we thought maybe we can make an album, or we are able to synthesize all of these different styles that we see as certainly related in terms of very dark music um so it was it was a long and sort of arduous recording process and I think we had a very big scope and a very large concept that we were trying to wrestle on to make some cohesive statement. And I'm not quite convinced it's the most cohesive statement and this is why I'm so much surprised it's such a favorite album but I remember being just a really open space a possibility in the studio and songwriting. We definitely took some risks with the piano and the guitar work and different instrumentation of the double bass and the accordion but I felt like that there was nothing we couldn't do with the mantle and it's an album that I'm certainly very happy with to this day.

The mantle was a massive undertaking for us. We spent a lot of time in the studio, spent a lot of time writing it, and it was kind of a critical album for us, because Pale Folklore had a lot more success than we had anticipated so it was our chance to make our grand album. And so we spent a lot of time on it and it just turned into this massive project that turned into many headaches and many problems but in the end again, just like with Pale Folklore, we can look back on it with pride and think that we basically tackled this big monster of an album that we're trying to create and I still look back on it and I listened to it very often and I'm very proud of it.

The mantle was an album that was created during a period of time when we we're not so interested in metal anymore. We kind of took a break from it. I was really not interested in what was going on in the scene or any new bands at that time. And plus, right after we recorded Pale folklore I left for Finland for a while and while in Finland I became very aware and a big fan of electronic music and so I kind of brought that back when I came back and we were very much into the so-called Neofolk scene more than we'd ever had been in the past. In addition, there was the whole industrial kind of scene from the 80s early 90s with bands like Swans, Laibach, and of course some newer sort of post Rock stuff like Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emperor! and Sigur RÃ³s and stuff like that. at the time so all of those kind of influences those non-metal influences really pull together on that album and once again when we were creating that album in the studio uh I kind of told told the engineer you know well this album is basically sort of like traveling from Portland to Mount Hood and back in a way because the way the songs are structured together in that in that album uh aesthetically and and atmospherically is kind of like the album starts at Crown Point where the photograph of us was taken for the vinyl that sort of panoramic Vista and it travels down through the Old Highway towards Hood River and then if you take Hood River to Mount Hood and you go through the mountains in the wilderness and stuff and then back to Portland and then back to Crown Point and so they kind of followed that whole album follows this kind of circle that ends kind of where it began um obviously you would only understand that if you're from Portland OR from this area but that was kind of the basis that we that we we built that album on and it's very different than what I think a lot of metal bands do you know especially a lot of bands that I I wouldn't want to I don't want to say pretend to be something they're not but you know who who utilize their their local influences I mean this that's basically how we we utilized ours and uh I think from an outside perspective that album might sound a little bit confused but it makes perfect sense if you're from this area and that's that was our our Portland album basically

13:19
Portland is a very important place for me and I really think that the mantle really
13:26
encompasses so much of the Aesthetics and so much of the vibe of Portland not only the artwork but the music the
13:32
themes and I really I think that
13:37
um if you listen to the mantle and you're familiar with Portland you will get the references you can you can
13:44
understand where Hawthorne passage comes from and desolation song and things like that you
13:50
can really appreciate and understand where those where the lyrics where the themes are coming from the imagery it
13:56
all wraps up and it just the whole thing just screams Portland and then you know after we've done the
14:01
mantle it was you know we looked back on it and we felt like maybe we need to
14:07
really redefine and refine the sound and so we wanted to make ashes a bit more of
14:12
a succinct statement it's more of a Back to Basics record which I don't think there was anything else we could do
14:17
after the sort of sprawling you know miasmic recording of the mantle and so
14:24
we really sort of stripped down and I think what was interesting about the ashes Against the Grain was that our
14:30
experience of redeveloping to a live act where we had to cut back in order to
14:36
present tracks from from the mantle into a live context with just two guitars
14:42
bass vocals drums it taught us uh what we could do with very little
14:48
and so I think we kept the album basic as a sort of inspiration from playing live and that's always usually been
14:53
inverted ashes Against the Grain was an album that we had to do at the time
15:00
we had really immersed ourselves so much in to the mantle that we just needed to
15:07
have an album that was just that kind of rocked more it was a bit more stripped down
15:13
and you know it was just pure energy and emotion
15:18
because the mantle was definitely not that it was more subdued and so
15:25
also at the time that that we were writing ashes I was kind of
15:30
kind of having a Renaissance with metal again because I was really listening to a lot of bands that I was had discovered
15:37
a lot of newer bands at the time as well as you know a lot of cold wave
15:43
stuff like Antarctica and once again sugar Rose and Ben's like Thule from Norway the Prague band
15:50
and um and we're listening to a lot of dark progressive rock so once again
15:56
those those influences came together and and we just created this album that was a
16:01
bit more stripped down and it just rocked more and I think
16:06
I think people were kind of afraid of what we were going to do when I when I gave that press release saying that it's
16:11
a bit more rock based but I I think that album is Is one of our
16:17
heaviest albums because it is so focused on electric guitars and when we started writing a recording for ashes we really
16:25
decided that we wanted to make a little bit more of a stripped Down album and it was the first album that we
16:30
recorded after we became a live working band touring playing shows and because
16:36
of that uh it really changed the way that we wrote the music and the way we approached the music without like the
16:42
mantle the sky was the limit but I'm like ashes we really wanted to kind of make it just more compact more
16:48
stripped down and um just a really just a like a really
16:56
powerful statement amidst the three full lengths I mean I think we've always really wanted to take
17:02
our time between them and use that time to sort of indulge ourselves and
17:07
experiment with what I would consider to be the more marginal sounds of agalog so for example
17:14
we wanted to do a noisier rock sort of um recording and we wouldn't want to do
17:20
a full length like that and so we came along with doing the lodge and we working it for the live which led to
17:26
doing this ep the gray EP but the same thing too with the ydp
17:32
being a sort of straight full KP you know for my theory for these these EPS
17:37
is that we don't want them to be major statements of our discography for me when you hear the full length you're
17:44
hearing the center of aglog whereas the EPS are kind of the margins it's kind of The Fringe it's where I feel like we had
17:51
the most freedom to really indulge ourselves and really develop some of the more fringier
17:58
aspects of our sound which I think ultimately helps Define our overall sound that we finally
18:06
release on a full length but that's why we like to limit them that's why we like to continue doing
18:12
them and I think that's something that we'll we'll always do as just a way to continue playing with and experimenting
18:18
or sound well the EPS that we release
18:24
their studies they're just they're a way for us to kind of step away from the album process which is
18:32
very developed and very you know there's a lot that goes into that and kind of step away from those kind of
18:39
pressures and put out something that's just a either a study of a certain aesthetic or just for something that's
18:45
just enjoyable you know like a like that split 10 inch that we did with our friend you know over in Finland um
18:53
uh in Nest uh that was a pure joy to record and
18:59
there's like no pressure in the studio and it was fantastic and the same could
19:04
be said about the gray AP and the wide EP and you know all of that stuff
19:10
uh like I said it's it's a way for us to to just kind of step back and
19:16
study a certain aesthetic and sometimes the the study pays off and we end up
19:22
using certain things uh certain elements of that uh on our next recording with
19:28
the gray AP in particular um there was a I did a remix of odol and
19:35
with that I took little tiny samples of different pieces of the guitars of the drums and I made this kind of massive
19:42
piece of noise basically it was ambient noise and a lot of the fans a lot of the
19:48
critics hated it but it was a it was a statement that we were making and it was just a piece of these these minor works
19:54
that the EPS are um you know with aglog live it's a very different band and what I appreciate
20:02
about when we emerged as a live Act was the challenge that presented to itself
20:07
to our the challenge that it presented musically which we ended up having to rewrite a lot of the material
20:14
and really rethink how can we you know reach the same sort of epic proportions
20:19
of some of the music with very limited instrumentation and so I found it to be
20:25
a productive and positive experience and if anything it just brought out a brand
20:30
new side a brand new feeling of ago and we never anticipated being there and so
20:36
this is why I think I'm very excited that there's the DVD out now and that
20:42
this side of agaloc is available but I think it's very very different than what you hear on the albums
20:47
playing live was never a big uh priority for us we were more interested in just
20:55
making demos and then making albums and focusing on that on that thing
21:01
um we started to play Live just because we were curious if we could pull it off
21:09
um you know and then the original intention was just to play three shows and then have that be it
21:16
um but it it seemed to work out really well and those three shows turned into you know
21:23
short West Coast tour and then it turned into a
21:28
East Coast tour and then turned into a European tour and you know and it just it kind of
21:33
kept going and we kept developing our what we did live and and some of the
21:39
Aesthetics that we would bring to our shows um I'm very much into having you know
21:47
banners and fog and those kind of things enhancing the the live performance as
21:54
well as um we we burn natural wood smoke incense on
22:00
stage and I I don't think it's very common in the metal scene I it's it's sometimes
22:07
utilized in the in the Neil folk scene but um for a metal band I think it's kind of unique to what to us
22:15
and uh we we do this to sort of set the tone of
22:21
and and you know because sometimes you know how certain Aromas and stuff will trigger a certain feeling
22:29
I think it fits perfectly with our our style of music and the feelings that we have in our music
22:35
so so live it definitely will burn this natural wood smoke incense and it will
22:41
sort of fill the air with this with this Aroma that highlights what
22:46
we're doing and I think that's something that we will continue to do until we
22:52
stop playing because it's it's a feature that I think is really really works for
22:58
us and it really works for um creating that enchanting atmosphere live
23:06
agaloc live is completely different than going into the
23:12
studio it's uh it's a very cathartic experience and it's it shows a totally
23:18
different side of the band A lot of the songs are Rewritten reworked rearranged we approached them
23:25
differently we think of them differently and agaloc live is the only time you're going to be able to really experience
23:31
those versions of those songs and it's really important to us to Breathe new life into the song is live
23:37
and so really this this DVD is really important to us because it's the first time we're able to document that
23:42
appropriately for example in the shadow of our pale companion it's a completely
23:49
different experience than on the record and it's it's nice to have like a
23:54
our songs are like living breathing beings they keep changing they keep evolving and this DVD really documents
24:01
that well this DVD release came about
24:08
when we were getting ready to play the Ragnarok Festival when we got invited to
24:14
play that Festival um a good friend of ours who's a promoter and an owner of a record chain
24:21
in in Belgium invited us to play again in Belgium and
24:29
one thing led to another I mean originally it wasn't it wasn't going to be a DVD release and up until a few
24:34
weeks before it actually happened we didn't even know if it was going to be filmed but you know we just basically he rented
24:41
a you know a camera crew and and we brought Chris from November's Doom to do our
24:47
sound and we just did it as if it was a norm C show
24:54
um and I think it turned out really well I think the final edit with it with the
25:01
entire show being in black and white is very evocative I think it's far more far
25:06
more interesting than than a color show especially when you got the type of thing where you don't really
25:13
have control over the type of lighting that's going on because we don't really have a lighting guy but
25:18
you can do so much more with with black and white in terms of just creating a
25:23
oblique feeling and we wanted we wanted the show to to
25:29
look like a you know like a Bellator film you know or something like or an old Birdman film you know it has that
25:35
that monochrome black and white kind of aesthetic you know and stuff so
25:42
that's why it's in black and white uh I hope you enjoy it if not well you
25:49
know go watch something else but uh but it also that monochrome attitude
25:57
and um approach that we took with the actual uh editing of the DVD or of the show
26:04
definitely I highlighted the photos that Valletta Thorson took while we were in
26:12
Belgium of these old Graves on a nature preserve
26:23
um folk metal well when we started we didn't set out
26:29
to be a folk metal band uh it's something that it's a style that kind of found us
26:36
um it seems although we're not really affected by what goes on in the scene and the
26:42
changes and what comes and goes it seems that sometimes because of our broad style we get lumped into a lot of new uh
26:51
sub-genres that come along like for instance in the early days we we never
26:56
set out to be a post-metal band either but when the mantle came out you know there weren't
27:02
that many so-called post-metal bands as they're called but as soon as that scene developed we
27:09
suddenly got lumped into that um and the same with folk metal uh my
27:15
attitude towards folk metal is that we don't really play
27:20
Pagan themed party music you know for us the the Heathen and Pagan uh
27:27
influences they're intertwined in the fabric of
27:32
what we do and so we don't really use you know any any band can can put a
27:38
bunch of runes or Viking um emblems on on their on their record and call themselves Viking metal or folk
27:45
metal um despite the fact that maybe they just play boring death metal you know uh for
27:51
us it's that stuff is just interwoven into the fabric of what we of what we do and so we don't really use that as a
27:59
shield for anything um but yeah as far as scenes are concerned uh like I said we
28:07
never really try to pay attention to what's going on with with new subgenres
28:12
that come along we just kind of sometimes get sucked into them um by the press or by fans or whatever
28:21
um some there was there was one smart alec
28:27
in the Press who put the genre tag of gray metal on us
28:32
and I think it I think it fit for what we were doing on the mantle but
28:39
overall it's not something that I would call our step our style
28:44
since day one we've been dark metal it's just pure and simple very Broad and
28:50
that's that's you know I think where we'll continue to to place ourselves
28:56
when I was I mean I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest but I grew up in another state
29:03
but but when I came back um you know I really forgot
29:08
how stunning you know the the nature is here and how it's so if so well fits
29:15
with the aesthetic of black metal and and things like that it's it's in the same way that I guess Norway does
29:23
um and I think that's one reason why you're starting to see something happen here with a lot of these kind of
29:31
Neo Pagan kind of black metal bands popping up in this region is I think it
29:36
just has something to do with with what the kind of Nature and natural
29:41
surrounding surroundings we have here and it's just it's very very powerful and as I say whenever it gets brought up
29:49
there's something here that haunts me and I think it's definitely a strong influence on us
29:58
um with regard to the future of agaloc you know here we are we're about almost reaching 11 years or so now and I think
30:07
we're all at the age where we can sort of look back and reflect and I don't think there's ever a moment where we really genuinely wanted to stop or give
30:13
up it feels like we're always thinking about it certainly agaloc has become a significant part of my own my identity
30:19
of who I am and I still feel even to this day that we're always excited about
30:24
what's next and I feel like we're lucky to have established a
30:29
a sort of musical narrative where we can experiment and develop and push on the
30:34
sound and that'll be expected by our listeners so I don't think there are I don't see us ending anytime soon
30:48
so this is what the first weekend in December of 2008 and uh
30:55
we're getting ready to start working seriously on our next on our next record
31:01
and we have some stuff written right now and I'm very very excited about it I think I
31:07
think our next album is certainly going to topple the other ones that we've that we've made and that's the way it should be
31:13
um you know we're always we're always striving to create
31:19
the the most expressive work we can um and I think it's going to be no
31:24
different Plus when we make an album we always wipe away the past we forget that we have
31:30
anything else out it's almost like creating a debut again because that way
31:36
you can you can create from a purely fresh start and
31:43
and I think the fact that we have three very distinct albums is a tribute or is a is because of that
31:52
um but yeah our next album I'm hoping we'll finish it next year but if not you know
31:58
maybe it'll come out in 2010 that we're never in a hurry and we never rush what we do we we prefer to
32:07
um you know take our time and create something that's going to be
32:12
that's going to have longevity to it you know and that's what's the most important thing to us

0:10
I wanted to have a name for a band that
0:15
really captured the the element and aesthetic of of wood smoke on a winter
0:21
night that that smell um and just that feeling and so um
0:27
you know I I didn't want to use a word or whatever that was just as prosaic as
0:32
wood smoke but um eventually I found the word agalloc it was just an old
0:37
dictionary and it was it's a type of wood that's burned for its unique smoke and so um it
0:44
was perfect and it was perfect for what I wanted and it didn't pigeonhole us um into one stylistic corner you know
0:51
genre whatever and so that was that was the name we went with and it's perfect well I met I
0:58
met John in 1996 through mutual friend um we were both at the time putting
1:04
together demos for our individual projects mind being sculptured as being agaloc and uh we had tremendous amounts
1:12
of things in common with regards to music Cinema and so it just naturally we
1:17
started collaborating and so when it came time to do for much of this Oak
1:22
demo I came down the studio did some guitar solos and thought that was going to be
1:28
it and that I was gonna go on and focus on my own project but as it turns out
1:35
um another mutual friend Jason Walton flew out to work with me ended up working
1:41
with John and from there we began forming agaloc into a pretty much a full
1:46
working band and that's when we started charting ideas for what eventually became pale folklore I
1:54
met John in 1991 we were both living in Montana and we were in high school and
2:01
we were both in different bands in the Montana area we got to know each other through there and we played a couple of
2:07
shows with each other and so we've been good friends for a very long time and years and years later he introduced
2:16
me to Don and at the time Don was just starting sculptured and he released the first
2:22
demo and I heard it and I was living in Minneapolis at the time and I wanted to leave
2:27
so basically we Don I became really good friends and I moved out to Portland to
2:33
join sculpture and John was living here as well so that worked out really well for everybody
2:39
um so this was after the first sculptured album was recorded So Don and
2:45
I were working on sculptured and John was working on agaloc and it was after the first agaloc demo as well and just
2:51
because we're all good friends and and we all had the same you know taste in music we started to work on on Phil
2:57
folklore together the attitude of the band since the beginning has always been a very take it
3:04
or leave it kind of attitude we've we've never really wanted to ever give in to
3:09
any sort of hype or or what you know care what the scene is doing at the time
3:15
we just we just do what we do we enjoy what we do and you know we just kind of
3:20
put it out there and it's like you know take it or leave it love it or hate it but we're not going to take it any
3:26
further than that in terms of promoting ourselves or anything because I don't really I've never been interested in
3:32
that and I've never really been interested in the whole concept of following a linear path to success or
3:40
whatever I've always just been more interested in cultivating and maintaining a strong cult following and
3:48
that's the most thing the most important thing to me and to us and if
3:55
success or whatever comes from that then that that it's just going to naturally happen or it won't so that's that's the
4:01
attitude that we've always had and the attitude that we'll we still have and we'll always have until the end
4:06
I mean pale folklore is it's still an album that I feel a great deal for Pride for and I still listen to it regularly I
4:15
feel like at that time we achieved what we wanted to achieve we had very specific I think
4:22
Direction with this album we had our points of Departures being
4:27
fields of the net forum some of the older Catatonia and of course the early
4:32
over work we kind of wanted to combine those three and bring the sort of fields of the Nephilim mood to
4:41
put a black metal and I remember when we recorded pale folklore
4:46
we had a friend visiting at the time and we hadn't laid down the clean tone
4:51
guitar parts yet when we did a friend remarked he didn't
4:57
like them at all and so we knew we were doing something hopefully original at that time
5:02
and uh I think we started kind of maybe a new sound with that sort of mixing that cling tone guitar going over sort
5:09
of heavy black metal guitars and I find that to be pretty much a key identity pay for aglock Hill
5:17
folklore was a was a really interesting experience for all of us I think because it was our first
5:23
it was our first exploration into agaloc as a full band and it was uh it was a it was a journey
5:32
of Discovery for us and it was just it was basically us getting together and creating an album that we all wanted to
5:39
hear it had a lot of different influences from Oliver to catatonia
5:44
two fields in the Nephilim bands that we all appreciated and it's a record I
5:50
still look back on today and I I feel like we we made a really solid
5:56
record that still stands up that album although it wasn't a conceptual album
6:03
per se it definitely followed the kind of a sort of red thread
6:10
and I think I remember telling the engineer
6:16
when we were making when we were creating it that I wanted it to be the sort of album that
6:22
imagine you know you're lost in the woods and it's snowing and it's cold and
6:29
you know you're gonna die if you don't find you know a shelter or something and you're the wind is blowing and it's just
6:35
it's brutal and you find I think a cabin that's falling apart you
6:41
know ruins of a cabin you know and you make it to these to this ruins of this of this cabin and you
6:47
open the door and it's illuminated and there's a fire and it's warm
6:52
and it's kind of like a transformation from life and death it's from this coldness brutality outside of and of
7:00
life and of death being this kind of warm comfortable place and and that that
7:06
run-down Cabin in the Woods is where you're going to be forever and that's kind of what I told the engineer I kind
7:12
of gave that story to the engineer to sort of paint this aesthetic picture of
7:18
of where we wanted to go with that album and where how I wanted that album to to feel and to and and whatnot so um that's
7:27
that's that was pale folklore there are certain things on it looking back sure I
7:33
would like to change I think it would be a lot better if we did an album like that nowadays but you know that's where
7:39
we were in 1998-99 um with the mantle I feel like this was
7:45
an album that we made where we felt the most um that there was Endless Possibilities
7:51
with where we could go and having done pale full Glory made that sort of more black metal statement both John and I
7:58
were spending a lot of time in Portland discovering new music together and we
8:03
went and saw godspeed to black Emperor live and it was very inspirational we felt like what was going on with that sort of
8:09
so-called post-rock scene those sort of groups could really easily translate into black metal
8:15
and we were also listening to a lot of like Nick Cave and the bad seeds and we really wanted to bring that and
8:23
also the Neo folk stuff we were into with crew 93 and so Invictus and we thought maybe we can make an album or we
8:28
are able to synthesize all of these different styles that we see as
8:33
um certainly related in terms of they're both you know it's very dark music
8:39
um so it was it was a long and sort of arduous recording process and I think we had a very big scope
8:46
and sort of a very large concept that we were trying to sort of wrestle on to a to make some sort of cohesive statement
8:52
and I'm not quite convinced it's the most cohesive statement and this is why I'm so much surprised it's such a
8:58
favorite album but I remember being just a really open space a possibility in the
9:03
studio and songwriting we definitely took some risks with the piano and the
9:08
guitar work and different instrumentation of the double bass and the accordion but I felt like that there
9:13
was nothing we couldn't do with the mantle and it's an album that I I certainly very very happy with to this
9:19
day the mantle was a massive undertaking for
9:26
us we spent a lot of time in the studio spent a lot of time writing it and it
9:32
was kind of a critical album for us because Hill folklore had a lot more success than we had anticipated
9:38
so it was kind of our chance to make our our grand album and so we spent a lot of
9:46
time on it and it just turned into this massive project that turned into many
9:51
many headaches and many problems but in the end you know again just with Kel folklore it's
9:58
we can look back on it with pride and think that we basically tackled this big monster of an album that we're trying to
10:05
create and I still look back on it and I listened to it very often and I'm very very proud
10:11
of it the mantle was an album that was created during a period of time when we
10:19
we're not so interested in metal anymore kind of took a break from it
10:26
I was really not interested in what was going on in the scene or any new bands at that time
10:32
and plus right after recorded or we recorded pal folklore
10:38
I left for Finland for a while and while in Finland I became very aware and a big
10:46
fan of electronic music and you know so I brought I kind of brought that back
10:52
when I came back and uh you know we were very much into the so-called Neil folk
10:58
scene more than we'd ever had been in the past and as well as like the whole industrial
11:05
kind of scene from the 80s early 90s like bands like swans layibach
11:11
um and of course some newer sort of post Rock stuff like Mogwai and Godspeed black Emperor and you know sugar roasts
11:18
and stuff like that at the time so all of those kind of influences those non-metal influences
11:25
really pull together on that album and
11:30
once again when we were creating that album
11:37
in the studio uh I kind of told told the engineer you
11:45
know well this album is basically sort of like traveling from Portland to Mount Hood and back in a way because
11:52
the way the songs are structured together in that in that album uh aesthetically and and atmospherically is
12:00
kind of like the album starts at Crown Point where the photograph of us was taken for
12:06
the vinyl that sort of panoramic Vista and it travels down through the Old
12:13
Highway towards Hood River
12:18
and then if you take Hood River to Mount Hood and you go through the mountains in the wilderness and stuff and then back
12:24
to Portland and then back to Crown Point and so they kind of followed that whole album follows this kind of circle that ends
12:31
kind of where it began um obviously you would only understand that if you're
12:37
from Portland OR from this area but that was kind of the basis that we that we we built that album on and it's
12:45
very different than what I think a lot of metal bands do you know especially a lot of
12:50
bands that I I wouldn't want to I don't want to say pretend to be something they're not but
12:57
you know who who utilize their their local influences I mean this that's basically how we we utilized ours and uh
13:06
I think from an outside perspective that album might sound a little bit confused but it makes perfect sense if you're
13:14
from this area and that's that was our our Portland album basically
13:19
Portland is a very important place for me and I really think that the mantle really
13:26
encompasses so much of the Aesthetics and so much of the vibe of Portland not only the artwork but the music the
13:32
themes and I really I think that
13:37
um if you listen to the mantle and you're familiar with Portland you will get the references you can you can
13:44
understand where Hawthorne passage comes from and desolation song and things like that you
13:50
can really appreciate and understand where those where the lyrics where the themes are coming from the imagery it
13:56
all wraps up and it just the whole thing just screams Portland and then you know after we've done the
14:01
mantle it was you know we looked back on it and we felt like maybe we need to
14:07
really redefine and refine the sound and so we wanted to make ashes a bit more of
14:12
a succinct statement it's more of a Back to Basics record which I don't think there was anything else we could do
14:17
after the sort of sprawling you know miasmic recording of the mantle and so
14:24
we really sort of stripped down and I think what was interesting about the ashes Against the Grain was that our
14:30
experience of redeveloping to a live act where we had to cut back in order to
14:36
present tracks from from the mantle into a live context with just two guitars
14:42
bass vocals drums it taught us uh what we could do with very little
14:48
and so I think we kept the album basic as a sort of inspiration from playing live and that's always usually been
14:53
inverted ashes Against the Grain was an album that we had to do at the time
15:00
we had really immersed ourselves so much in to the mantle that we just needed to
15:07
have an album that was just that kind of rocked more it was a bit more stripped down
15:13
and you know it was just pure energy and emotion
15:18
because the mantle was definitely not that it was more subdued and so
15:25
also at the time that that we were writing ashes I was kind of
15:30
kind of having a Renaissance with metal again because I was really listening to a lot of bands that I was had discovered
15:37
a lot of newer bands at the time as well as you know a lot of cold wave
15:43
stuff like Antarctica and once again sugar Rose and Ben's like Thule from Norway the Prague band
15:50
and um and we're listening to a lot of dark progressive rock so once again
15:56
those those influences came together and and we just created this album that was a
16:01
bit more stripped down and it just rocked more and I think
16:06
I think people were kind of afraid of what we were going to do when I when I gave that press release saying that it's
16:11
a bit more rock based but I I think that album is Is one of our
16:17
heaviest albums because it is so focused on electric guitars and when we started writing a recording for ashes we really
16:25
decided that we wanted to make a little bit more of a stripped Down album and it was the first album that we
16:30
recorded after we became a live working band touring playing shows and because
16:36
of that uh it really changed the way that we wrote the music and the way we approached the music without like the
16:42
mantle the sky was the limit but I'm like ashes we really wanted to kind of make it just more compact more
16:48
stripped down and um just a really just a like a really
16:56
powerful statement amidst the three full lengths I mean I think we've always really wanted to take
17:02
our time between them and use that time to sort of indulge ourselves and
17:07
experiment with what I would consider to be the more marginal sounds of agalog so for example
17:14
we wanted to do a noisier rock sort of um recording and we wouldn't want to do
17:20
a full length like that and so we came along with doing the lodge and we working it for the live which led to
17:26
doing this ep the gray EP but the same thing too with the ydp
17:32
being a sort of straight full KP you know for my theory for these these EPS
17:37
is that we don't want them to be major statements of our discography for me when you hear the full length you're
17:44
hearing the center of aglog whereas the EPS are kind of the margins it's kind of The Fringe it's where I feel like we had
17:51
the most freedom to really indulge ourselves and really develop some of the more fringier
17:58
aspects of our sound which I think ultimately helps Define our overall sound that we finally
18:06
release on a full length but that's why we like to limit them that's why we like to continue doing
18:12
them and I think that's something that we'll we'll always do as just a way to continue playing with and experimenting
18:18
or sound well the EPS that we release
18:24
their studies they're just they're a way for us to kind of step away from the album process which is
18:32
very developed and very you know there's a lot that goes into that and kind of step away from those kind of
18:39
pressures and put out something that's just a either a study of a certain aesthetic or just for something that's
18:45
just enjoyable you know like a like that split 10 inch that we did with our friend you know over in Finland um
18:53
uh in Nest uh that was a pure joy to record and
18:59
there's like no pressure in the studio and it was fantastic and the same could
19:04
be said about the gray AP and the wide EP and you know all of that stuff
19:10
uh like I said it's it's a way for us to to just kind of step back and
19:16
study a certain aesthetic and sometimes the the study pays off and we end up
19:22
using certain things uh certain elements of that uh on our next recording with
19:28
the gray AP in particular um there was a I did a remix of odol and
19:35
with that I took little tiny samples of different pieces of the guitars of the drums and I made this kind of massive
19:42
piece of noise basically it was ambient noise and a lot of the fans a lot of the
19:48
critics hated it but it was a it was a statement that we were making and it was just a piece of these these minor works
19:54
that the EPS are um you know with aglog live it's a very different band and what I appreciate
20:02
about when we emerged as a live Act was the challenge that presented to itself
20:07
to our the challenge that it presented musically which we ended up having to rewrite a lot of the material
20:14
and really rethink how can we you know reach the same sort of epic proportions
20:19
of some of the music with very limited instrumentation and so I found it to be
20:25
a productive and positive experience and if anything it just brought out a brand
20:30
new side a brand new feeling of ago and we never anticipated being there and so
20:36
this is why I think I'm very excited that there's the DVD out now and that
20:42
this side of agaloc is available but I think it's very very different than what you hear on the albums
20:47
playing live was never a big uh priority for us we were more interested in just
20:55
making demos and then making albums and focusing on that on that thing
21:01
um we started to play Live just because we were curious if we could pull it off
21:09
um you know and then the original intention was just to play three shows and then have that be it
21:16
um but it it seemed to work out really well and those three shows turned into you know
21:23
short West Coast tour and then it turned into a
21:28
East Coast tour and then turned into a European tour and you know and it just it kind of
21:33
kept going and we kept developing our what we did live and and some of the
21:39
Aesthetics that we would bring to our shows um I'm very much into having you know
21:47
banners and fog and those kind of things enhancing the the live performance as
21:54
well as um we we burn natural wood smoke incense on
22:00
stage and I I don't think it's very common in the metal scene I it's it's sometimes
22:07
utilized in the in the Neil folk scene but um for a metal band I think it's kind of unique to what to us
22:15
and uh we we do this to sort of set the tone of
22:21
and and you know because sometimes you know how certain Aromas and stuff will trigger a certain feeling
22:29
I think it fits perfectly with our our style of music and the feelings that we have in our music
22:35
so so live it definitely will burn this natural wood smoke incense and it will
22:41
sort of fill the air with this with this Aroma that highlights what
22:46
we're doing and I think that's something that we will continue to do until we
22:52
stop playing because it's it's a feature that I think is really really works for
22:58
us and it really works for um creating that enchanting atmosphere live
23:06
agaloc live is completely different than going into the
23:12
studio it's uh it's a very cathartic experience and it's it shows a totally
23:18
different side of the band A lot of the songs are Rewritten reworked rearranged we approached them
23:25
differently we think of them differently and agaloc live is the only time you're going to be able to really experience
23:31
those versions of those songs and it's really important to us to Breathe new life into the song is live
23:37
and so really this this DVD is really important to us because it's the first time we're able to document that
23:42
appropriately for example in the shadow of our pale companion it's a completely
23:49
different experience than on the record and it's it's nice to have like a
23:54
our songs are like living breathing beings they keep changing they keep evolving and this DVD really documents
24:01
that well this DVD release came about
24:08
when we were getting ready to play the Ragnarok Festival when we got invited to
24:14
play that Festival um a good friend of ours who's a promoter and an owner of a record chain
24:21
in in Belgium invited us to play again in Belgium and
24:29
one thing led to another I mean originally it wasn't it wasn't going to be a DVD release and up until a few
24:34
weeks before it actually happened we didn't even know if it was going to be filmed but you know we just basically he rented
24:41
a you know a camera crew and and we brought Chris from November's Doom to do our
24:47
sound and we just did it as if it was a norm C show
24:54
um and I think it turned out really well I think the final edit with it with the
25:01
entire show being in black and white is very evocative I think it's far more far
25:06
more interesting than than a color show especially when you got the type of thing where you don't really
25:13
have control over the type of lighting that's going on because we don't really have a lighting guy but
25:18
you can do so much more with with black and white in terms of just creating a
25:23
oblique feeling and we wanted we wanted the show to to
25:29
look like a you know like a Bellator film you know or something like or an old Birdman film you know it has that
25:35
that monochrome black and white kind of aesthetic you know and stuff so
25:42
that's why it's in black and white uh I hope you enjoy it if not well you
25:49
know go watch something else but uh but it also that monochrome attitude
25:57
and um approach that we took with the actual uh editing of the DVD or of the show
26:04
definitely I highlighted the photos that Valletta Thorson took while we were in
26:12
Belgium of these old Graves on a nature preserve
26:23
um folk metal well when we started we didn't set out
26:29
to be a folk metal band uh it's something that it's a style that kind of found us
26:36
um it seems although we're not really affected by what goes on in the scene and the
26:42
changes and what comes and goes it seems that sometimes because of our broad style we get lumped into a lot of new uh
26:51
sub-genres that come along like for instance in the early days we we never
26:56
set out to be a post-metal band either but when the mantle came out you know there weren't
27:02
that many so-called post-metal bands as they're called but as soon as that scene developed we
27:09
suddenly got lumped into that um and the same with folk metal uh my
27:15
attitude towards folk metal is that we don't really play
27:20
Pagan themed party music you know for us the the Heathen and Pagan uh
27:27
influences they're intertwined in the fabric of
27:32
what we do and so we don't really use you know any any band can can put a
27:38
bunch of runes or Viking um emblems on on their on their record and call themselves Viking metal or folk
27:45
metal um despite the fact that maybe they just play boring death metal you know uh for
27:51
us it's that stuff is just interwoven into the fabric of what we of what we do and so we don't really use that as a
27:59
shield for anything um but yeah as far as scenes are concerned uh like I said we
28:07
never really try to pay attention to what's going on with with new subgenres
28:12
that come along we just kind of sometimes get sucked into them um by the press or by fans or whatever
28:21
um some there was there was one smart alec
28:27
in the Press who put the genre tag of gray metal on us
28:32
and I think it I think it fit for what we were doing on the mantle but
28:39
overall it's not something that I would call our step our style
28:44
since day one we've been dark metal it's just pure and simple very Broad and
28:50
that's that's you know I think where we'll continue to to place ourselves
28:56
when I was I mean I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest but I grew up in another state
29:03
but but when I came back um you know I really forgot
29:08
how stunning you know the the nature is here and how it's so if so well fits
29:15
with the aesthetic of black metal and and things like that it's it's in the same way that I guess Norway does
29:23
um and I think that's one reason why you're starting to see something happen here with a lot of these kind of
29:31
Neo Pagan kind of black metal bands popping up in this region is I think it
29:36
just has something to do with with what the kind of Nature and natural
29:41
surrounding surroundings we have here and it's just it's very very powerful and as I say whenever it gets brought up
29:49
there's something here that haunts me and I think it's definitely a strong influence on us
29:58
um with regard to the future of agaloc you know here we are we're about almost reaching 11 years or so now and I think
30:07
we're all at the age where we can sort of look back and reflect and I don't think there's ever a moment where we really genuinely wanted to stop or give
30:13
up it feels like we're always thinking about it certainly agaloc has become a significant part of my own my identity
30:19
of who I am and I still feel even to this day that we're always excited about
30:24
what's next and I feel like we're lucky to have established a
30:29
a sort of musical narrative where we can experiment and develop and push on the
30:34
sound and that'll be expected by our listeners so I don't think there are I don't see us ending anytime soon
30:48
so this is what the first weekend in December of 2008 and uh
30:55
we're getting ready to start working seriously on our next on our next record
31:01
and we have some stuff written right now and I'm very very excited about it I think I
31:07
think our next album is certainly going to topple the other ones that we've that we've made and that's the way it should be
31:13
um you know we're always we're always striving to create
31:19
the the most expressive work we can um and I think it's going to be no
31:24
different Plus when we make an album we always wipe away the past we forget that we have
31:30
anything else out it's almost like creating a debut again because that way
31:36
you can you can create from a purely fresh start and
31:43
and I think the fact that we have three very distinct albums is a tribute or is a is because of that
31:52
um but yeah our next album I'm hoping we'll finish it next year but if not you know
31:58
maybe it'll come out in 2010 that we're never in a hurry and we never rush what we do we we prefer to
32:07
um you know take our time and create something that's going to be
32:12
that's going to have longevity to it you know and that's what's the most important thing to us
