    "interviewer": "Basically, you're coming from the other part of the world and you're coming to another continent to the east side and yet you're receiving such a good response. Honestly, did you expect this in this part of the world?",
    "John": "It's not really that much of a surprise because we've always had a great response in the Czech Republic and it seems likethe further East we go Europe, the more people are hungry for this kind of music. Plus, we had been told that there was a lot of fans in Romania and Hungary and in this region so we knew it was going going to be good. We didn't know it was going to be this good."

    {
    "interviewer": "It's not a secret that your music is more well received in Europe than in the US, I mean, judging from the fact that in the US this kind of music isn't so much promoted as the new new scene, I mean the the whole hardcore, metalore scene. Your music is more focused on the European side. Do you think that if the band was was born in a country in Europe, would it have a different pattern, not from the music, but for the whole, to be known?",
    "John": "It's really hard to say. When we started, the majority of bands that sounded like us were from Europe, so it's possible that we could have just got lost in the sea of endless similar sounding bands. Whereas in the States, you know, 96, 97, when we started, it was very unheard of to have this type of Europeanesque influenced dark metal. For the first probably 5 years people thought we were from Europe, they thought we were from Finland or something. Geography really doesn't matter as long as you have the spirit to play this kind of music."

    {
    "interviewer": "Are you guys working hard on the new the new record, which is pretty much expected?",
    "John": "Our hype machine is broken right now. I mean we're not a band that really likes to talk a lot. If we don't have very important news, we're not going to say anything. We prefer to just sort of dwell in the shadows and do our thing at a very quiet, slow pace. We got other things going on in our lives, we're not just constantly working on a new record, we will work on it for maybe a month and then we'll not work on it for a month. It's bit by bit, but the whole next record is finished. I need to finish some lyrics which I'll probably write this week when I'm on vacation in Romania. But other than that, we're ready to record it and hopefully we will start recording when Asop gets back from his tour with Ludicra, which is going to be May or June. So everything's done and I've already started the layout for the record, so when it is finished we can just send it straight to the label and hopefully it will get released as soon as possible."

    {
    "interviewer": "In your opinion, is it really hard to put the studio records on the live session? I mean, the songs are very complex, it's rather hard to put it in the live set.",
    "John": "Oh yeah, if we don't have perfect sound on stage it's a disaster. Like, tonight was kind of one of those nights where we didn't have very good sound on stage and so we decided we'll [ __ ] it, we'll put our heart and soul into it and just let that guide the way. I think people react very positively to that kind of attitude. It doesn't necessarily matter if you're hitting all the right notes as long as you're hitting people where it counts."

    {
    "interviewer": "You're also a graphic designer. Do you earn your living from that?",
    "John": "I'm a freelance designer but I don't really earn a a constant living from it. It's a nice perk you know, money here and there. I don't know if many people know that I do design. I mainly do design for Agalloch and others related projects but I'm generally too busy to really do a full-time design, job or whatever. I'm very selective and generally it's my own related projects that I'm doing design for. I did do the design for Kagay on issue 10, which is one of the reasons why I'm here in Romania. It was my payment to show me a good time in Romania and that's what he's going to do this week so it's going to be pretty cool I think."
  },
    {
    "interviewer": "In this aspect, did you have any Inspirations from painters or other designers?",
    "John": "As far as designers who influence me, there's a few. I really like you know some of Seldon Hunt's work, um I like some of Stephen O'Malley work. I see stuff here and there that inspires me a lot of older Dutch painters and things like that, but as far as graphic designers in general, I tend to just stick to my own. I've had influences when I first began designing like Stephen O'Malley and some other people like that but I try to find my own aesthetic and style and I try to stay away from trying to be too influenced by others."
  },
    {
    "interviewer": "One last question regarding your lyrics. They're actually very profound, every song has a meaning of its own, I want to ask how do you see the world right now? In in this moment, in general, with all the problems.",
    "John": "Life goes on. I mean, what can you say, it always seems like every day gets worse and worse. When I think back 10 years ago, I think wow, we didn't have this problem, we didn't have this problem, and then it makes me wonder, God damn, in 10 years what's it going to be like, and it just seems like the world is just sort of spiraling into a catastrophic mess. You just have to find your way through it and find your own sort of pleasure and meaning that makes life worthwhile. Otherwise, I would have just killed myself probably 10 years ago. That's one of the things that we really enjoy with Agalloch, it gives us an opportunity to really have fantastic experiences like coming to Romania and playing in front of 700 maniacs, playing last night at this classical theater in Bra»ôov and being the first metal band ever to play that place and we sold it out. It's just like wow you know that's incredible."

    {
    "interviewer": "Tell me about touring frequency and touring outside the States.",
    "John": "We don't tour very often because we can't. There are just too many schedule conflicts with the members, but when we do bring it together, we put our heart and soul into it and we try to give the best possible performance we can because we never know when we're going to do it again. We never know when we'll be back in Romania again, or anywhere else, and there's so many places in the world we'd like to see, as well as playing more places in the States because I feel like we've kind of neglected the the US. But at the same time it also depends on the offers we get. For every one okay offer we'll get in the States we'll get 10 fantastic offers from Europe, so you have to prioritize well what's worth our time the most and what's going to give us the most interesting and profound experience rather than just what's going to give us the most money. We don't really care about that, we just want to have a great experience and have it paid for, and give people a great show and see the see the world that's crumbling down."
