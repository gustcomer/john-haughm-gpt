    "John": "I wanted to have a name for a band that really captured the element and aesthetic of wood smoke on a winter night. that smell and that feeling and so, you know, I didn't want to use a word or whatever that was just as prosaic as wood smoke. but Eventually I found the word agalloc. it was in an old dictionary and it was a type of wood that's burned for its unique smoke and so it was perfect for what I wanted and it didn't pigeonhole us into one stylistic corner, or genre, or whatever. And so that that was the name we went with and it's perfect."

    "interviewer": "How was Agalloch formed?",
    "Don": "Well, I met John in 1996 through a mutual friend. We were both at the time putting together demos for our individual projects, mine being Sculptured his being Agalloch, and we had tremendous amounts of things in common with regards to music, cinema and so just naturally we started collaborating. When it came time to do From Which of this Oak demo I came down the studio, did some guitar solos and thought that was going to be it and that I was gonna go on and focus on my own project. But as it turns out another mutual friend Jason Walton flew out to work with me, and were working with John and from there we began forming Agalloch into pretty much a full working band. And that's when we started charting ideas for what eventually became Pale Folklore."

    "interviewer": "How did you meet the other Agalloch members?",
    "Jason": "I met John in 1991. We were both living in Montana, we were in high school and we were both in different bands in the Montana area. We got to know each other there and we played a couple of shows with each other and so we've been good friends for a very long time. Years and years later he introduced me to Don and at the time Don was just starting Sculptured and he released the first demo and I heard it and I was living in Minneapolis at the time and I wanted to leave. So basically, Don I became really good friends and I moved out to Portland to join sculpture and John was living here as well so that worked out really well for everybody. So this was after the first sculptured album was recorded So Don and I were working on Sculptured and John was working on Agalloch and it was after the first Agalloch demo as well and just because we're all good friends and we all had the same taste in music, we started to work on Pale Folklore Together."
