    "interviewer": "What's the origin of the bands name?",
    "John": "I wanted to have a name for a band that really captured the element and aesthetic of wood smoke on a winter night. that smell and that feeling and so, you know, I didn't want to use a word or whatever that was just as prosaic as wood smoke. but Eventually I found the word agalloc. it was in an old dictionary and it was a type of wood that's burned for its unique smoke and so it was perfect for what I wanted and it didn't pigeonhole us into one stylistic corner, or genre, or whatever. And so that that was the name we went with and it's perfect."

    "interviewer": "How was Agalloch formed?",
    "Don": "Well, I met John in 1996 through a mutual friend. We were both at the time putting together demos for our individual projects, mine being Sculptured his being Agalloch, and we had tremendous amounts of things in common with regards to music, cinema and so just naturally we started collaborating. When it came time to do From Which of this Oak demo I came down the studio, did some guitar solos and thought that was going to be it and that I was gonna go on and focus on my own project. But as it turns out another mutual friend Jason Walton flew out to work with me, and were working with John and from there we began forming Agalloch into pretty much a full working band. And that's when we started charting ideas for what eventually became Pale Folklore."

    "interviewer": "How did you meet the other Agalloch members?",
    "Jason": "I met John in 1991. We were both living in Montana, we were in high school and we were both in different bands in the Montana area. We got to know each other there and we played a couple of shows with each other and so we've been good friends for a very long time. Years and years later he introduced me to Don and at the time Don was just starting Sculptured and he released the first demo and I heard it and I was living in Minneapolis at the time and I wanted to leave. So basically, Don I became really good friends and I moved out to Portland to join sculpture and John was living here as well so that worked out really well for everybody. So this was after the first sculptured album was recorded So Don and I were working on Sculptured and John was working on Agalloch and it was after the first Agalloch demo as well and just because we're all good friends and we all had the same taste in music, we started to work on Pale Folklore Together."

    "interviewer": "How's the attitude of the band?",
    "John": "The attitude of the band since the beginning has always been a very take it or leave it kind of attitude. We've never really wanted to ever give in to any sort of hype, or care what the scene is doing at the time. We just do what we enjoy what we do and we just kind of put it out there and it's like take it or leave it, love it or hate it but we're not going to take it any further than that in terms of promoting ourselves or anything because I've never been interested in that and I've never really been interested in the whole concept of following a linear path to success or whatever. I've always just been more interested in cultivating and maintaining a strong cult following and that's the most important thing to me and to us and if success or whatever comes from that then it's just going to naturally happen or it won't so that's the attitude that we've always had and the attitude that we still have and we'll always have until the end."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album Pale Folklore?",
    "Don": "Pale Folklore is still an album that I feel a great deal of Pride for and I still listen to it regularly. I feel like at that time we achieved what we wanted to achieve. We had very specific direction with this album, we had our points of departure being Fields of the Nephilin, some of the older Catatonia and of course the early Ulver work. We kind of wanted to combine those three and bring the sort of Fields of the Nephilim mood to black metal. I remember when we recorded Pale Folklore we had a friend visiting at the time and we hadn't laid down the clean tone guitar parts yet, and when we did, he remarked he didn't like them at all and so we knew we were doing something hopefully original at that time. I think we started kind of maybe a new sound with that sort of mixing, that cling tone guitar going over, sort of heavy black metal guitars, and I find that to be pretty much a key identity for Agalloch."
