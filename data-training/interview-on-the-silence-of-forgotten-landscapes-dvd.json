    "interviewer": "What's the origin of the bands name?",
    "John": "I wanted to have a name for a band that really captured the element and aesthetic of wood smoke on a winter night. that smell and that feeling and so, you know, I didn't want to use a word or whatever that was just as prosaic as wood smoke. but Eventually I found the word agalloc. it was in an old dictionary and it was a type of wood that's burned for its unique smoke and so it was perfect for what I wanted and it didn't pigeonhole us into one stylistic corner, or genre, or whatever. And so that that was the name we went with and it's perfect."

    "interviewer": "How was Agalloch formed?",
    "Don": "Well, I met John in 1996 through a mutual friend. We were both at the time putting together demos for our individual projects, mine being Sculptured his being Agalloch, and we had tremendous amounts of things in common with regards to music, cinema and so just naturally we started collaborating. When it came time to do From Which of this Oak demo I came down the studio, did some guitar solos and thought that was going to be it and that I was gonna go on and focus on my own project. But as it turns out another mutual friend Jason Walton flew out to work with me, and were working with John and from there we began forming Agalloch into pretty much a full working band. And that's when we started charting ideas for what eventually became Pale Folklore."

    "interviewer": "How did you meet the other Agalloch members?",
    "Jason": "I met John in 1991. We were both living in Montana, we were in high school and we were both in different bands in the Montana area. We got to know each other there and we played a couple of shows with each other and so we've been good friends for a very long time. Years and years later he introduced me to Don and at the time Don was just starting Sculptured and he released the first demo and I heard it and I was living in Minneapolis at the time and I wanted to leave. So basically, Don I became really good friends and I moved out to Portland to join sculpture and John was living here as well so that worked out really well for everybody. So this was after the first sculptured album was recorded So Don and I were working on Sculptured and John was working on Agalloch and it was after the first Agalloch demo as well and just because we're all good friends and we all had the same taste in music, we started to work on Pale Folklore Together."

    "interviewer": "How's the attitude of the band?",
    "John": "The attitude of the band since the beginning has always been a very take it or leave it kind of attitude. We've never really wanted to ever give in to any sort of hype, or care what the scene is doing at the time. We just do what we enjoy what we do and we just kind of put it out there and it's like take it or leave it, love it or hate it but we're not going to take it any further than that in terms of promoting ourselves or anything because I've never been interested in that and I've never really been interested in the whole concept of following a linear path to success or whatever. I've always just been more interested in cultivating and maintaining a strong cult following and that's the most important thing to me and to us and if success or whatever comes from that then it's just going to naturally happen or it won't so that's the attitude that we've always had and the attitude that we still have and we'll always have until the end."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album Pale Folklore?",
    "Don": "Pale Folklore is still an album that I feel a great deal of Pride for and I still listen to it regularly. I feel like at that time we achieved what we wanted to achieve. We had very specific direction with this album, we had our points of departure being Fields of the Nephilin, some of the older Catatonia and of course the early Ulver work. We kind of wanted to combine those three and bring the sort of Fields of the Nephilim mood to black metal. I remember when we recorded Pale Folklore we had a friend visiting at the time and we hadn't laid down the clean tone guitar parts yet, and when we did, he remarked he didn't like them at all and so we knew we were doing something hopefully original at that time. I think we started kind of maybe a new sound with that sort of mixing, that cling tone guitar going over, sort of heavy black metal guitars, and I find that to be pretty much a key identity for Agalloch."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album Pale Folklore?",
    "Jason": "Pale Folklore was a really interesting experience for all of us I think because it was our first exploration into Agalloch as a full band and it was a journey of discovery for us and it was basically us getting together and creating an album that we all wanted to hear. It had a lot of different influences from Ulver to Catatonia, to Fields of the Nephilim, bands that we all appreciated. It's a record I still look back on today and I feel like we made a really solid record that still stands up."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album Pale Folklore?",
    "John": "That album, although it wasn't a conceptual album per se, it definitely followed the kind of red thread. I remember telling the engineer when we were creating it that I wanted it to be the sort of album that you could imagine you know you're lost in the woods and it's snowing and it's cold and you know you're gonna die if you don't find you know a shelter or something, and the wind is blowing and it's just brutal. Then you find a cabin that's falling apart, ruins of a cabin, and you make it to these to this ruins of this cabin and you open the door and it's illuminated and there's a fire and it's warm. It's kind of a transformation from life and death, it's from this coldness brutality outside of life, and of death being this kind of warm comfortable place. That run-down Cabin in the Woods is where you're going to be forever and that's kind of what I told the engineer. I kind of gave that story to the engineer to paint this aesthetic picture of where we wanted to go with that album and how I wanted that album to to feel and whatnot, so that was Pale Folklore. There are certain things on it looking back that sure I would like to change. I think it would be a lot better if we did an album like that nowadays but that's where we were in 1998-99."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album The Mantle?",
    "Don": "With The Mantle, I feel like this was an album that we made where we felt the most that there was endless possibilities with where we could go. And having done Pale Folklore sort of more a black metal statement, both John and I were spending a lot of time in Portland discovering new music together and we went and saw Godspeed You Black Emperor! live and it was very inspirational. We felt like what was going on with that sort of so-called post-rock scene, those sort of groups could really easily translate into black metal. And we were also listening to a lot of like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and we really wanted to bring that and also the Neofolk stuff we were into with Crew 93 and Sol Invictus and we thought maybe we can make an album, or we are able to synthesize all of these different styles that we see as certainly related in terms of very dark music um so it was it was a long and sort of arduous recording process and I think we had a very big scope and a very large concept that we were trying to wrestle on to make some cohesive statement. And I'm not quite convinced it's the most cohesive statement and this is why I'm so much surprised it's such a favorite album but I remember being just a really open space a possibility in the studio and songwriting. We definitely took some risks with the piano and the guitar work and different instrumentation of the double bass and the accordion but I felt like that there was nothing we couldn't do with the mantle and it's an album that I'm certainly very happy with to this day."

    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album The Mantle?",
    "Jason": "The mantle was a massive undertaking for us. We spent a lot of time in the studio, spent a lot of time writing it, and it was kind of a critical album for us, because Pale Folklore had a lot more success than we had anticipated so it was our chance to make our grand album. And so we spent a lot of time on it and it just turned into this massive project that turned into many headaches and many problems but in the end again, just like with Pale Folklore, we can look back on it with pride and think that we basically tackled this big monster of an album that we're trying to create and I still look back on it and I listened to it very often and I'm very proud of it."
  },
  {
    "interviewer": "How do you feel about the album The Mantle?",
    "John": "The mantle was an album that was created during a period of time when we we're not so interested in metal anymore. We kind of took a break from it. I was really not interested in what was going on in the scene or any new bands at that time. And plus, right after we recorded Pale folklore I left for Finland for a while and while in Finland I became very aware and a big fan of electronic music and so I kind of brought that back when I came back and we were very much into the so-called Neofolk scene more than we'd ever had been in the past. In addition, there was the whole industrial kind of scene from the 80s early 90s with bands like Swans, Laibach, and of course some newer sort of post Rock stuff like Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emperor! and Sigur RÃ³s and stuff like that. At the time, all of those kind of non-metal influences really pull together on that album and once again when we were creating that album in the studio I told the engineer that this album is basically like traveling from Portland to Mount Hood and back in a way. Because the way the songs are structured together in that album aesthetically and atmospherically is like the album starts at Crown Point where the photograph of us was taken for the vinyl, with that sort of panoramic Vista and it travels down through the Old Highway towards Hood River. And then if you take Hood River to Mount Hood and you go through the mountains in the wilderness and stuff and then back to Portland and then back to Crown Point, the whole album follows this kind of circle that ends where it began. Obviously you would only understand that if you're from Portland or from this area but that was kind of the basis that we built that album on and it's very different than what I think a lot of metal bands do, especially a lot of bands that I don't want to say that pretend to be something they're not, but who utilize their local influences. I mean this that's basically how we utilized ours and thinking from an outside perspective, that album might sound a little bit confused but it makes perfect sense if you're from this area and that was our our Portland album basically."
