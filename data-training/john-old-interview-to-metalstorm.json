    "interviewer": "Hi guys, first and foremost let me congratulate you on your latest album 'Ashes Against The Grain', which is creating quite a buzz around the world. I am pleased to tell you that it is currently voted album number 1 of the year 2006 by our website members. That brings my first question. Do you feel like Agalloch is finally getting the recognition it deserved through hard work and dedication? I mean, it is your third full-length album and all three are absolute masterpieces.",
    "John": "It's cool. I'm sometimes surprised to see these kinds of reactions and I hope that our work will stand the test of time. We've never been a band that feeds off of mass recognition anyway. We just do what we do and hope it turns out for the best. I mean, we would do everything exactly the same even if no one knew or cared about us."
